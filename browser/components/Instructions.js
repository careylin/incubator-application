				Fill out the form and press the submit button to apply to the Cornish Incubator Program.  Applications are due by June 1st, and will not be accepted after that (though the form may still be available).  Essays should be approximately 200 words, but applications will not be disqualified if they are longer, and shorter is encouraged.  Applications will be reviewed, and the point of contact will be notified by August 1st.  Note that applications cannot be restarted after the window is closed, so you must complete the application in one session.
